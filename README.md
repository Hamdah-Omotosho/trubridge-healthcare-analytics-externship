# Trubridge-healthcare-analytics-externship

This project showcases my 8-week remote externship experience with TruBridge, where I explored how data analytics can be applied to healthcare challenges using Python and AI tools.


## üìå Project Scope

Over the course of the externship, I worked on:
- Defining a healthcare research question using AI
- Cleaning and preparing public datasets using Python (Pandas + NumPy)
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Creating data visualizations based on research insights
- Building a final dashboard and presenting findings


## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Google Colab**
- **Claude + ChatGPT** (AI research assistance)
- **Gamma** (AI-powered presentations)
- **Public healthcare datasets**

## üìä Key Files
- `/colab_notebooks/`: Python notebooks for data cleaning and analysis
- `/presentation/`: Final AI-generated slides
- `/dashboard/`: Screenshots or exported dashboard insights

## üìé Outcome
By the end of the program, I had:
- Gained practical experience in real-world data exploration
- Strengthened Python and data analysis skills
- Delivered a research-backed AI presentation and dashboard
